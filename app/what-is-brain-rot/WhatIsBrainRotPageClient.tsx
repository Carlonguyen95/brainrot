      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Brain Rot and Gen Z Culture</h2>
      <p>
        The concept of "brain rot" is closely tied to Gen Z internet culture. It reflects a self-aware, often ironic
        acknowledgment of how digital media shapes language and thinking. While older generations might view excessive
        social media use as genuinely harmful to cognitive function, Gen Z often uses the term playfully to describe
        their relationship with internet content.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brain rot has become part of a larger lexicon of Gen Z slang terms that includes phrases like "no cap" (not
        lying), "bussin" (really good), and "rizz" (charisma or charm). These terms spread rapidly through platforms
        like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter, becoming integral to youth communication.

      <p>
        While "brain rot" is primarily used as a humorous internet term, some researchers have studied the effects of

        media consumption might affect our brains, particularly for younger users who are still developing cognitively.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it's important to note that when Gen Z users talk about having "brain rot," they're usually being
        hyperbolic and self-deprecating rather than describing an actual medical condition.

        document.
